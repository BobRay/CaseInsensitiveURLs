CaseInsensitiveURLs Extra for MODx Revolution
=============================================


**Author:** Bob Ray <http://bobsguides.com> [Bob's Guides](http://bobsguides.com)

Documentation is available at [Bob's Guides](http://bobsguides.com/caseinsensitiveurls-tutorial.html)

CaseInsensitiveURLs assumes that you are using Friendly URLs and that all your aliases are all lowercase.

The Plugin redirects page requests for mixed-case URLs to the lowercase version when the mixed-case version is not found. URL query parameters will not be altered. The Plugin will not slow down your site because it only executes when the page-not-found event fires.
