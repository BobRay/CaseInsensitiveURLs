<p>On servers where URLs are case-sensitive, User's who try to access a page using a link that is in the wrong case will encounter a 404 (page-not-found) error. This Plugin for MODX Revolution let's users find your pages even when the case of a link or an address entered in the browser's address bar is incorrect.</p>

<p>CaseInsensitiveURLs assumes that you are using Friendly URLs and that all your aliases are all lowercase. If this is not the case, the Plugin is no good for you.</p>

<p>When a requested page is not found and the URL is mixed-case, the Plugin redirects the user to the lowercase version of the same URL. CaseInsensitiveURLs will not alter any query strings (any part of the URL following a '?' character), so they can be mixed case.

CaseInsensitiveURLs will not slow down your site because it only executes when the page-not-found event fires.</p>



<h3>Installing CaseInsensitiveURLs</h3>

<p>
Go to System | Package Management on the main menu in the MODX Manager and click on the "Download Extras" button. That will take you to the
Revolution Repository (AKA Web Transport Facility). Put CaseInsensitiveURLs in the search box and press Enter. Click on the "Download" button, and
when it changes to "Downloaded," click on the "Finish" button. That should bring you back to your Package Management grid. Click on the
"Install" button next to CaseInsensitiveURLs in the grid. The CaseInsensitiveURLs package should now be installed.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Once you install the Plugin, it will go to work. No further action is required.</p>
